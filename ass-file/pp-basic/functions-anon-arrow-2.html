      //Hard reinforcement
      //1 Write an arrow function that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array where each even number is doubled, and each odd number remains the same. Use a loop instead of map.

      //2 Create a function expression that accepts an array of numbers and returns the sum of all negative numbers. Use filter to extract the negative numbers, but calculate the sum with a loop instead of reduce.

      //3 Write a function that takes a string and returns an object where the keys are each vowel found in the string, and the values are the counts of each vowel. This is similar to counting characters but focuses on vowels only.

      //4 Using a function expression, write a function that takes an array of strings and returns an array of the same strings sorted by the number of vowels in each string, from fewest to most. Youâ€™ll need to write a helper function that counts vowels, then use that for sorting.

      //5 Write an arrow function that takes two arrays and returns an array of elements that are only present in one array or the other, but not in both (symmetric difference). Avoid using sets or additional array methods.
